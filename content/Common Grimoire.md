Common spells require [[Control Tier]] T1–T2 and represent the backbone of everyday [[Flux]] use across [[Solumora]]. The majority of the population can cast at least some of these. They are the spells found in every home, workshop, and market stall — mass-produced, widely copied, and deliberately simple.
